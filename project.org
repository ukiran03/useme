* Specifications
* Project =Useme=
A trash-cli like utility, light and mnemonic

=useme= /I don't let you loose your files/
* Workspace dir
=~/prog/groundworks/usemetestdir/=

* Few things to consider from =rm=
Checkout info
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(info "(coreutils) rm invocation")
#+end_src

** Recursive Deletion
#+begin_src sh
$ rm dir1 file1
rm: cannot remove 'dir1': Is a directory
             # deletes file1, but fails to delete dir1
#+end_src

- Our intended behavoir is ask for confirmation: Y/[N] (no is default)
  If No then should not delete =file1= either.

** Removing files like =-foo.txt=
#+begin_src sh
$ \rm -foo.txt
rm: invalid option -- 'o'
Try 'rm ./-foo.txt' to remove the file '-foo.txt'.
Try 'rm --help' for more information.
#+end_src

** Usage with zero arguments (files)
Then, =um= should print the files in list with a character (if possible)
